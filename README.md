This is repository for Tower Defence game on Godot engine.

# Concept

At the beginning of the level, the crystal has 100% hp. Purchased defenders are automatically placed on the battlefield and automatically attack the enemy. Enemies come in waves. If the enemy reaches the crystal, he begins to damage it. When the crystal xp <= 0, we lost. We get money for killing an enemy. For money, we can use effects. The task is to hold all the waves so that the base xn does not become <= 0.

# Enemy

Enemies differ in speed, base damage, attack range, and hp. The enemy dies when his health is <= 0. The enemy moves along the shortest path to the base.

# Protection

Protection is a character. They differ in damage and speed of attack. Damage by area is possible.

#Store

In the store, you can buy and pump the level of defenders.
